    <p> Artist Statement: In this course, Composing Digitial Media (ENGCOMP 0610 SEC1070), I completed a series of projects 
        that included multiple stages of developing in order to demonstrate a result. During these projects, I used multiple 
        platforms like Audacity, Adobe Premier Pro, and finally Visual Studio Code that I find will help me in years to come as 
        a Data Science major here at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor Addison Eldin teached a detailed class in order 
        for us to learn skills helpful for project and desgin building in the future. I gained a lot of knowledge through this class, and 
        determined my strentghs and weaknesses in Composing Digital Media in order to have improvements to make for the future.

    <p>     In order to create this project website, I went through a great deal of discovering HTML and CSS that helped
        me discover the details to make this project the best it could be. Using Visual Studio Code was very interesting and I find
        that I will be using in the future for other projects as well as coding assignments.
            The first step, understanding HTML was argubaly less confusing, but also much more important in learning the rules
        I needed to make a successful page. The different elements allowed me to really comprehend the importance of them quickly
        and efficiently as the difficulty of HTML continued to increase.
            The second step with CSS was definitly more challenging and added a lot of complexity on top of HTML to create
        the visual layout for my portfolio website. I appreciated the knowledge I gained during the CSS teaching as it helped
        my page really come together involving the colors and other small details.
