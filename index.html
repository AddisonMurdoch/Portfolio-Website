    <p> Artist Statement: In this course, Composing Digitial Media (ENGCOMP 0610 SEC1070), I completed a series of projects 
        that included multiple stages of developing in order to demonstrate a result. During these projects, I used multiple 
        platforms like Audacity, Adobe Premier Pro, and finally Visual Studio Code that I find will help me in years to come as 
        a Data Science major here at the University of Pittsburgh. Professor Addison Eldin teached a detailed class in order 
        for us to learn skills helpful for project and desgin building in the future. I gained a lot of knowledge through this class, and 
        determined my strentghs and weaknesses in Composing Digital Media in order to have improvements to make for the future.
