<p> For my audio narrative, I choose to focus on the historic impact female 
    basketball player Caitlin Clark has on women sports. Diving into not only her 
    stats, I discuss the ways she is seen extraordinary off the court as well. 
    I hope you enjoy, please take a listen!  </p>

<h1> Audio Narrative README</h1>
<h2> Summary </h2>
<p> In my Audio narrative, I chose to write about the infamous women's athlete 
    Caitlin Clark. Not only are here records and basketball stats speaking for 
    itself, she has been an inspiration for all athletes in the world. Many people
     continue to discuss what makes her so special, and I want to mainly touch on what 
     most people don't say about her. On and off the court, this legendary player 
     and person highlights how important sports are to society, and Caitlin Clark is 
     seen as a role model to everyone, whether a basketball fan or not. Using some of
     her article appearances along with interviews, I will reach the intended audience, 
     and ultimately set a precedent for what this athlete has done and will continue to
     do for women in sports. </p>

         Women’s Basketball by Storm</a> </li>
<p> I used this source to incorporate a lot about Caitlin Clark’s childhood and 
    hometown life. A lot of what makes her so special roots from what she was 
    brought into from her family, friends, town, and the sport of basketball. 
    Taking a lot of information from this piece, I included some more detail into her 
    life as an evolving super star on and off the court. </p>

<p> For this source, I focused more on Caitlin’s current and very present impact on 
    women’s sports and sport history as an athlete at the professional level now. Coming 
    from Iowa and now in the WNBA, I added some information about how she inspires people as a 
    growing phenomenon, and how people view her as she continues to be in the spotlight.</p>

<p> For my video essay, I had the idea of discussing and daking a deeper look into the city of 
    Pittsburgh and the ways in which our history as being the Steel City has shaped our community.
    Dating back to the first steel mills, to the highlights of the city's sports teams, I hope you can take
    away the narrative of the steel mentality Pittsburgh has grown! </p>

    <h1>Video Essay README</h1>
    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>My video essay focuses on the bond between sports teams in Pittsburgh with the community, but more specifically how the history of the cities industrial background affects it sports identity. I will show the exploration of the cities sports teams, and it's cultural changes within different time periods to today. Instead of focusing on a broad relationship between Pittsburgh sports teams, and its community, I hope to prove a point that the history of this city has much significance to today's modern identity when it comes to the pride of it, sports teams. I have uploaded it to YouTube but also provided the link on canvas as well.</p>
